# Simple Flocking

This is a godot implementation of [Craig Reynolds Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids). A more detailed breakdown of [Boids with pseudocode can be found here](http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html).

# Running the Demo

Click F5 to run the default screen. Then click anywhere on the screen to issue a waypoint for the boids. The boids will continue to chase mouse clicks.

Controls: 
* left click - place target flag
* right click - scatter the boids to random locations on the screen.
